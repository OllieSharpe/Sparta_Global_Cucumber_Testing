# Sparta_Global_Cucumber_Testing

This repo contains automated UI tests performed on a practice shopping website. The main purpose of the tests is to check the process of carrying an order through the entire checkout process and confirming that the order is placed correctly. The tests are run using cucumber and are written in the Given, When, Then format specified by the Gherkin language. Selenium is used through Capybara to write the automation for the chrome web-browser.
